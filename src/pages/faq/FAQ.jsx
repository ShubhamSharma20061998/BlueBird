            <h6>What is Radiation?</h6>
            <p>
              Radiation is nothing but a process in which Energy is emitted as
              waves or particles. The complete process in which energy is
              emitting from one body, transmitted through a medium or space and
              absorbed by another body.

            <h6>What is the source of radiation?</h6>
            <p>
              Radiation exists at every corner of the earth. The intensity of
              the radiation verifies from one place to another. Due to low level
              of radiation, we are unable to feel its impact. It is produced
              naturally and artificially also. Medical equipment’s like x-ray
              machines, microwaves, radio frequency, ultraviolet rays, gamma,
              and others are source of radiation.

            <h6>How far Radiation can travel?</h6>
            <p>
              Depends upon the type of radiation and the ability to penetrate
              other materials or medium. Alpha and beta radioactive particles
              can’t travel too far at all, and they are easily blocked due to
              less penetrating ability. But gamma rays, x-rays, and neutrons
              travel a notable distance and are difficult to block naturally
              (particularly for large radioactive sources).
            </p>
            <p>
              Alpha (a) radiation consists of a fast-moving helium-4 (4
              He)nucleus and is a stopped by a sheet of paper. Beta
              (β)radiation, consisting of electrons, is halted by an aluminium
              plate. Gamma (Y) radiation, consisting of energetic photons, is
              eventually absorbed as it penetrates a dense material. Neutrons
              (n) radiation consists of free neutrons that are blocked by light
              elements, like hydrogen, which slow and/or capture them. Not
              Shown: galactic cosmic rays that consist of energetic charged
              nuclei such as protons, helium nuclei, and high-charged nuclei
              called HZE ions.

            <h6>What do Radioactive Sources look like?</h6>
            <p>
              Radioactive sources should be “sealed” as per the law and act.
              Usually they are very small, their size can vary from tiny seeds;
              used in cancer treatment, to the size of the tip of a ballpoint
              pen or may up to several inches in length, depending on the
              material and its configuration.

            <h6>How can I tell something is Radioactive?</h6>
            <p>
              Without any radiation detector it is not possible to detect
              something as a Radioactive. It is important to know what type of
              detector you have and the type of radiation — alpha, beta, gamma,
              x-ray, and/or neutron — that it can detect. Scanning an object
              with a typical gamma/x-ray radiation detector will not detect
              alpha particles.

              Are there any pills to take to protect somebody from Radiation?
            </h6>
            <p>
              Potassium Iodide (KI) protects people from thyroid cancer caused
              by radioactive iodine. One type of radioactive material that can
              be released in nuclear explosions. KI should only be taken in a
              radiation emergency that involves the release of KI. Since the use
              or release of radioactive iodine from a “dirty bomb” is highly
              unlikely, KI pills would not be useful.

              Who regulates the Radioactive materials & Radiation Exposure?
            </h6>
            <p>
              Our Country has a long-term plan of wide applications of nuclear
              radiations and radioactive sources for peaceful applications for
              mankind. Like in; medicine, industry, agriculture and research.
              Already having several places in the country where such sources
              are being used. These places are mostly outside of the Department
              of Atomic Energy (DAE) installations. DAE supplies such sources.
              The most important application of nuclear energy in DAE is in
              electricity generation through nuclear power plants. Around 22
              such nuclear reactors are operating now. In view of the above
              mentioned wide spread applications, Indian parliament through an
              Act, called Atomic Energy Act, 1962 created an autonomous body
              called Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) with authority and
              powers. This Board issues licenses, codes, guides, manuals, etc.,
              to regulate such installations to ensure safe use of such sources
              and crews engaged in such installations and environment, receives
              radiation exposures within the maximum limit prescribed by them.
              Periodic reports are submitted to AERB to demonstrate compliance
              of its directives. Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) Group of
              Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Mumbai and various regional
              offices carry out necessary surveillance and monitoring of all
              installations of the DAE on a routine basis and periodic
              inspections of other installations using radiation sources. Some
              of the nuclear fuel cycle plants like nuclear power plants and
              fuel reprocessing involve large radioactive source inventories and
              have potential of accidental release of radioactivity into the
              environment. The data is provided to AERB and is available to
              members of the public. In addition, a multi-tier system of AERB
              permissions is in place to ensure that all aspects of safety have
              been considered before permission to operate is granted. The
              stages where permission of AERB is essential are site selection,
              design data, and several stages during construction and operation.
              The details required by AERB include provision for treatment and
              storage of radioactive waste, de-commissioning procedures and
              provision of costs. In addition to AERB, nuclear power plants must
              comply with the requirements of Ministry of Environment and
              Forests and get their clearance. This is given based on
              Environmental Impact Assessment Report which should satisfy the
              authorities that no ecological damage will be caused, and the
              facility will not have adverse effect on the environment. In
              addition, the State Pollution Control Board where the facility is
              to be located must permit the site of the plant for its proposed
              discharges into the environment. It is largely due to the above
              comprehensive regulatory controls that none of the plants in India
              had any accident during the last 34 decades of operation. The type
              of measurements carried out by the ESL’s and results from a few
              typical ESL’s will be presented.

            <h6>Why do you need to be careful around radiation?</h6>
            <p>
              It is vital to protect ourselves from the harmful impact of
              radiation. Radiation should be handled sensitively, it has both
              negative and positive influence in our daily basis life. Radiation
              is also used for curing sever diseases like cancer, on the other
              hand, excessive exposure of radiation can lead you to serious
              diseases like cancer, thyroid, leukemia etc. Radiation can damage
              our living cell and DNA; thus, it is crucial to be careful around
              high radiation locality.

            <h6>What is the worst, Radiation can do to you?</h6>
            <p>
              Radiation can even kill you if you are exposed to enough of it. By
              doing so much damage to your organs and body that your body can’t
              do no longer operational functions. The regulatory system for
              radioactive materials is designed to prevent the possibility that
              anyone could receive an exposure even close to the levels that
              might suffer a painful and short-term damage.
            </p>
            <p>
              The simplest preventions against harmful radiation exposure are
              time, distance and shielding. Limit the time you are exposed to
              the radioactive source; increase the distance between you and the
              source; and shield yourself by placing objects between you and the
              source. These concepts form the basis of nuclear regulation so
              that we may enjoy the beneficial uses of radioactive materials
              while minimizing the risk to public health and the environment.

              What would be the bare minimum quantity of Radiation, which can
              affect any area or locality?
            </h6>
            <p>
              There is no conception like that. Ionizing Radiation can’t be
              measured like that. Everything is depending upon the activity of
              the source.

              Is leakage not possible in improper shielding of a radioactive
              source?
            </h6>
            <p>
              Law and order never allows us to keep a radioactive source without
              proper shielding. If even that is kept like as said, leakage shall
              be there and that unexpectedly dangerous for the mankind. Being a
              professional, we never suggest keeping a radioactive source like
              that.
